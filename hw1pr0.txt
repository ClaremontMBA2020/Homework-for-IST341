Q1. Anderson refers to one's "MySpace" page. This is a clear, if superficial, way in which this article (at less than a decade old) shows its age. What is a deeper way in which the ideas of this article betray thinking that has moved on since 2008? Contrast one of its ideas with more recent thinking, which can be your own, others', or both. 
There are many scientific model that explain phenomenon in our world, but many of them are used because we did not have enough computer power. However, we have great computer power today and we can throw data into analysis tools and we can analyze the outcomes. So, there are needs of understanding how to reasoning the outcome and rebuild models that fits into data and real life. We can apply this same thing into any field of profession and it is going to be important factor in our life to thrive in coming years.  



Q2. The article states that, whether in science or business, we "don't have to settle for models at all." Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How? And why? Certainly feel free to articulate a more nuanced or hybrid view, if you'd like.
I believe most of models are invalid today due to realization of outcomes from data analysis. therefore, we need to rebuild models to analyze what is happening and predict future. However, there is no way that 100% we can predict future and any misconduct people or business would create. so, my understanding of this statement is that tehre are many jobs will be automated and replaced, but there many jobs still stays same way but with data analysis works, which help business to perform better and create additional values in order to satisfy everyone.
